# Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps for deployment are as follows:

    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
    - From the Source section dropdown menu, select the Master branch.
    - Once the master branch has been selected, the page provides the link to the completed website.

- I started off by creating a local git repo with the command `git init`, then at regular points, I added new changes with the command `git add .`, then committed them to my local git staging area with `git commit -m 'useful comment'`, then pushed my local git repo to the external one using `git push`.

# Credits

- Most of the code was created from the course (Code Institute course).
- Advice from my mentor.

# Bugs

- I had problems with placing the code, I hadn't put them in order.
    - Solution: I replaced them in a good order.
- Also with CSS, I was having a problem, Gitpod didn't load up the command from style.css.
    - Solution: I added the Meta class.
